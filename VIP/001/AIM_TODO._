        0. REFACTOR_NOTE_TCL <<<< Colors in wrong order now.

        0. REFAC_ORDER:VOD_ALT_INV < REFACTOR AND RENAME
                                     THE TABLE TAGED WITH
                                     "VOD_ALT_INV"

        1. SEE_TAG[ SB2_REFAC_ME ].
           This will need some re-ordering too.
           d_rulgeom_v16_sb2 <-- needs looking at.

            MATCAT__RELATED SECTION NOT REFACTORED YET.


        1. Optimized seeking through simulation's bombs
           by using a linked-list-array-hybrid.


        2. RE-Order The Material Types In Our BFJ shader
           so they are sorted correctly by[ ma3 ]and[ ma5 ]
           categories.

        3. RENAME/REFACTOR : F_EVT_N10 ==> F_EVT_N10_PADNUMS

        4. What is this all about ?

        5. BLACK_ENERGY / DARK_ENERGY / VOID_ENERGY tiles.
           When two different "flame types" mix , it
           turns into "dark energy". Dark energy blasts
           last longer than any other blast type. This 
           is implemented to help fix the fact that only
           one explosion type can exist at a time on the
           tilemap.
